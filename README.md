# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires creating an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

The user can now enter the zip code of a city, and the answer to the question (How are feeling today?). Then, the app will fetch the data corresponding to that city from an API on OpenWeatherMap.com and extract the temperature and add it alongside with the user input and the current date to the application endpoint on a local server.
Finally the information will be fetched from the application endpoint to be shown to the user on the UI.

This is achieved using two asynchronous functions in the app.js. Also the app can catch wrong inputs and alert the user with the error. And of course proper routes, for adding and retrieving data to and from the application endpoint, were added to the server.js file.
